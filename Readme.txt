Solver(q1): Can be run on any Python IDE which supports interactive programming. Input file to be created before execution is named input_q1.csv
Generator(q2): Can be run on any Python IDE which supports interactive programming.
Test cases provide various kinds of outputs as well as inputs. Each of the test case files can be copied to input_q1.csv and fed to the solver program. Expected outputs are all compiled in the outputs.csv file in the tests folder.
